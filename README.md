# PRIME: Prediction of Response and Impact of Medical Efficacy

In the NEAT-AMBIENCE project, we address the development of novel and appropriate data management techniques to assist citizens in their daily lives. One of our use cases is related to the health area. Here, we focus on the problem of predicting the efficacy of drugs. Thus, we tackle the development of data management techniques for drug efficiency prediction and decision making. 

## Acknowledgments and funding

- Roberto García Peña (student at the University of Zaragoza) developed the related TFG "Management and analysis of drug outcome data for patients with infections", supervised by David Ojeda (NTT Data) and Sergio Ilarri.
- Our research is framed in the R&D project PID2020-113037RB-I00, funded by MCIN/AEI/ 10.13039/501100011033. The initial prototype has been developed thanks to an academic project in cooperation with NTT DATA.
- In addition to the previous project (NEAT-AMBIENCE project), the support of the Department of Science, University and Society of Knowledge of the Government of Aragon (Government of Aragon: COSMOS group; last group reference: T64_23R) is also appreciated.

"Next-gEnerATion dAta Management to foster suitable Behaviors and the resilience of cItizens against modErN ChallEnges (NEAT-AMBIENCE)" (PID2020-113037RB-I00), funded by the Spanish State Research Agency (MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033). Principal Investigator: Sergio Ilarri.
